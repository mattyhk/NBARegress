MIT Undergraduate Advanced Project

This is an attempt to run some regression analysis on players' shots. The analysis will take into account Season factors, Game factors, Player factors, and Situation factors.

The goal is to be able to predict with some certainty the likelihood of a player's shot going in. 

The data was taken from ESPN's play by play data from 2006 until last season (2012-2013). It was taken by a web crawler created for this project.

There are also some plotting scripts and plots that may be of interest.
